What I've learned: how to make my profile, how to find people's work and make edit requests
What I'm confused about: how they can respond to my edits.. do they incorporate them, or is my edit only my branch? Is my edit part of their workspace?

One practice for computational reproducibility from Wilson et al:
One of their suggestions for software reproducibility is to make the requirements of your package/program explicit (eg with a "requirements" document) so that any users will know exactly what they need in order to run this program. This is important to ensure that a program can work for others, and is not relying on something unknown that the original creator had installed. This is important for R so that you can keep track of which packages/libraries you need to have in order for the program to run correctly.
